This project is meant to be a 'whistle-blower' platform for the public.
If you notice government officials in active acts of corruption, you can raise a Red Flag.
If you come accross a public project that was not handled well or is in a deplorable state,
you can raise an Intervention Flag.
In this way the public is always kept abreast of the state of public projects and also of
erring government officials.
In our own little way, we can roll-back corruption.
Thank you.
